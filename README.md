Scott Logic Coding Challenge


## What is it?
Write a program to buy and sell shares. The highest profit wins.

Two classes:
- TradeManager - list of methods that can buy or sell shares
- DailyInput - a list of methods that gets the share prices


When you decide to buy or sell shares we make the sale or purchase using the close price.
